# DNS

DNS is an outbound protocol used for intercepting and forwarding DNS queries.

This outbound protocol can only handle DNS traffic, including queries based on UDP and TCP protocols. Other types of traffic will result in an error.

When handling DNS queries, this outbound protocol will forward IP queries (A and AAAA) to the built-in [DNS server](../dns.md). Other types of query traffic will be forwarded to their original destination addresses.

## OutboundConfigurationObject
