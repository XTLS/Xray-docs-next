## XTLS? Xray? V2Ray?

**XTLS are brilliant ideas for TLS we study, while Xray is the best practice we maintain.**

- Xray-core is a superset of v2ray-core, with better overall performance and enhancements such as XTLS, and it's~~completely~~compatible with v2ray-core functionality and configuration.
  - Only one executable file, including ctl functionality, run is the default command
  - Configuration is~~completely~~compatible, environment variables and API calls need to be changed to start with XRAY\_
  - Exposed raw protocol's ReadV on all platforms
  - Provides complete VLESS & Trojan XTLS support, both with ReadV
  - Provides multiple XTLS flow control modes, unrivaled performance!

> "Configuration compatible, overall better"
