# The Great Chronicles

## 2024.9.12

The Great Chronicles Return to the Scene?!

## 2024.9.7 <Badge>[v24.9.7](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v24.9.7)</Badge>

First release after abandoning semantic versioning.

- This time, QUIC and DomainSocket transports were removed, along with two pieces of legacy code.
  - The binary size is 1MB smaller than v1.8.24.
- As always, there are essential bug fixes.

## 2024.8.30 <Badge>[v1.8.24](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.24)</Badge>

While waiting for the SplitHTTP multiplex controller, the main branch had accumulated many important updates, so we decided to release a version first.

- The Socks inbound now supports HTTP proxy requests by default.
- UDP noise (preview)
- And some other improvements.

Due to the existence of semantic versioning, planning features and scheduling for each release have severely hindered the development, merging, and release of new features. Therefore, we decided to abandon semantic versioning starting with the next release and use the release date as the version number, such as v24.8.30, and cancel version planning, fully adopting continuous updates. Features will be merged and released as soon as they are ready, with a version released at the end of each month.

After all, as a software aiming to help people bypass censorship, instead of maintaining a long-term stable version, it's more important to adapt new features and keep updating monthly.

The next version will remove some legacy code no longer in used, add warning log for using deprecated features/configs, and for sure, some breaking changes. Be aware that future versions will be released once we consider something new is ready for a release.

We believe that with your donations and the reform of the release format, the Xray-core project will develop even better.

## 2024.8.26

The Project VLESS group was established.

We have created [Project VLESS](https://t.me/projectVless) for non-Chinese users (mainly Russian).

## 2024.8.3

The first [Project X NFT](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/discussions/3633#discussioncomment-10240940) is officially released! Just as Xray has made history, releasing an NFT is also an unprecedented move in this field. These NFTs are highly commemorative and even historically significant, far beyond their current initial price. In time, they will undoubtedly become priceless. Once again, thank you for your support of Project X.

## 2024.7.29 <Badge>[v1.8.23](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.23)</Badge>

- Congratulations to [@mmmray](https://github.com/mmmray) for contributing the 1000th commit to Xray-core!
- Optimized the stability of SplitHTTP upstream, and the server must be upgraded to this version to support the new client.
- More changes on SplitHTTP.

## 2024.7.22 <Badge>[v1.8.21](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.21)</Badge>

It seems to have returned to the original state of rapid-fire releases...

As foreshadowed in v1.8.16, SplitHTTP now preliminarily supports HTTP/3 (QUIC). Undoubtedly, SplitHTTP H3 has ushered in a new era.

- SplitHTTP H3 is the first QUIC-based proxy fully compliant with standard H3, supporting CDN passthrough, and can be concealed using reverse proxy or Browser Dialer.

## 2024.7.16

Project X documentation now has a Russian version! Thanks to [@iambabyninja](https://github.com/iambabyninja) for the translation!

## 2024.7.15

Through known information and efforts, Xray-core now supports Windows 7 again! In subsequent releases, Windows 7 users can enjoy it by downloading and extracting the Xray-win7-32.zip or Xray-win7-64.zip packages. Thank you for your support! For specific usage, please click [here](../document/install.html)

Although Windows 7 will eventually be phased out with future upgrades, we can now delay that time a little.

## 2024.6.18 <Badge>[v1.8.16](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.16)</Badge>

A new transport has arrived, currently called SplitHTTP.

- There are two completely opposite ways to achieve further traffic obfuscation: multiplexing and splitting connections.
- It can achieve the same goals as Meek through CDNs that do not support WebSocket or gRPC, and SplitHTTP is simpler and more efficient than Meek.
- SplitHTTP does not have WebSocket's ALPN issues, which is a major advantage, and it will support HTTP/3 (QUIC) in the future.
- SplitHTTP has also been added to the sharing link package.

## 2024.6.2

A new transport method is being developed...

## 2024.4.26 <Badge>[v1.8.11](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.11)</Badge>

Added HTTPUpgrade transport, said to be lighter than WebSocket.
- Already added to the sharing link package.

## 2024.2.29

gRPC transport now also has a Host-like configuration field! It's called `authority`. Now gRPC can also "domain front," without ALPN issues.

## 2024.2.25 <Badge>[v1.8.8](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.8)</Badge>

- Now XUDP traffic is uniformly padded with Vision, come and experience it.
- Added leastLoad balancer.
- Fixed errors, optimized performance...

## 2024.1.9

Shocked to hear that Win7 cannot run the new version of Xray-core? Upon exploration, it was discovered that Go has dropped support for Win7. Is there a way to continue supporting this somewhat ancient but still elegant operating system?

## 2023.11.21

The [paper](https://t.me/projectXtls/212) published at the USENIX top conference confirms that XTLS Vision has achieved its design goals. And XTLS will not stop there, breaking through towering walls like X-rays.

## 2023.11.18 <Badge>[v1.8.6](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.8.6)</Badge>

Now Shadowsocks-2022 relay is also supported.

## 2022.5.29 <Badge>[v1.5.6](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.5.6)</Badge>

Shadowsocks-2022 protocol has come to Xray-core!

- Thanks to [@nekohasekai](https://github.com/nekohasekai) for developing the brand new go implementation https://github.com/SagerNet/sing-shadowsocks and bringing it to Xray.
- Thanks to [@database64128](https://github.com/database64128) for driving the Shadowsocks community to propose a complete design.
- Thanks to [@RPRX](https://github.com/RPRX) for submitting the original vulnerability.

Shadowsocks-2022 is a newly designed protocol:

- It addresses security issues like replay attacks while retaining native udp support from Shadowsocks (using timestamps similar to vmess, so client and server need synchronized time).
- Supports multi-user on a single port, and implements session mechanisms similar to quic and wireguard to reduce encryption overhead and ensure seamless migration during network changes.

## 2022.4.24 <Badge>[v1.5.5](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases/tag/v1.5.5)</Badge>

For some unspeakable reasons, Xray‚Äôs documentation website was sneakily launched before the release date.
The URL is: [Yes, what you‚Äôre looking at](https://xtls.github.io).

Everyone is welcome to check various contents and correct any errors/suggestions (can be submitted to the issue area of the documentation GitHub repository).

The documentation website needs continuous improvement and content addition, as well as design refinement.
Therefore, everyone is welcome to contribute to the construction of the documentation together.
[Documentation Repository](https://github.com/XTLS/XTLS.github.io).

There‚Äôs a brief tutorial in the repository's README explaining how to help Xray improve the documentation website.
Everyone is welcome to check it out, correct errors, modify, and add experiences.
