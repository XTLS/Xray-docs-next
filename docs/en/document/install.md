#### Arch Linux CN

First add [Arch Linux CN](https://www.archlinuxcn.org/archlinux-cn-repo-and-mirror/) repository, and then use the root user `pacman -S xray`to install.

### Linuxbrew

The Linuxbrew package manager is used in the same way as Homebrew: `brew install xray`

### Debian <Badge text="WIP" type="warning"/>

### Gentoo

Currently, three third-party Overlays provide Portage installation scripts:

- **[CHN-beta/touchfish-os](https://github.com/gentoo-mirror/touchfish-os/tree/master/net-proxy/Xray)**: Individually maintained, designed for systemD systems
- **[Gentoo-zh](https://github.com/microcai/gentoo-zh)**: Community-maintained, designed for systemD systems
- **[JuanCldCmt/Xray-Overlay](https://github.com/JuanCldCmt/Xray-Overlay)**: Individually maintained, designed for openRC systems. Runs under the `xray` user group for enhanced security

Use `layman` or `eselect-repository` to add the Overlay to your local repository, then install.

## Install via Docker

Currently two different styles of Docker images are provided:

- [teddysun/xray](https://hub.docker.com/r/teddysun/xray): Root privileges, shell environment, compatible with all architectures supported by Alpine. Compiled and built via a private server (dl.lamp.sh). Offers better ease of use
- [ghcr.io/xtls/xray-core](https://ghcr.io/xtls/xray-core): Rootless, no shell environment, supports more architectures. Compiled from the official repository with build provenance. Sacrifices convenience for extreme security
